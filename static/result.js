// so if i am passing ingredients (a python object stored in a psql database) to an html page
// & i want my script to take in ingredients, read its attributes and use those attributes to 
// get the database information via my crud.py functions
// how would i do that?

// how would i get ingredients.ingredient_id in js & pass it into get_ingredient_by_id()
// so i can get the exact ingredient details associated with that particular ingredient
