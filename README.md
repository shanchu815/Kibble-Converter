# Kibble Converter
Kibble Converter is a resource site that lets pet owners find out whatâ€™s in their pet food. This site includes two different converters - one for for foods made in the US (under FDA standards) and foods made in the EU (under FEDIAF standards). It also includes a comparison calculator to let users find the true protein contents of their products, making the process far less tedious. Currently, this only applies to foods made for cats and dogs.

Kibble Converter is a web app created by Shannon Chu. Shannon is passionate about pets, but currently has never owned one. As there was a lack of APIs and reputable sites regarding pet nutrition, she undertook quite the challenge of manually collecting and comparing data in order to create a database for Kibble Converter. As of 2023, Kibble Converter is currently no longer deployed but a demo of its functions can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbufeOuMMs4

Each page features a randomly generated cat or dog photo captioned with a random cat or dog fact. These facts and images are obtained from various pet APIs.
