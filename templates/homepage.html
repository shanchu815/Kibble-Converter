            <p>Have you ever looked at a pet food label and been confused by the ingredient names and terms like "crude protein content"?</p>
            <p>Tired of keeping a bunch of tabs open or bookmarked on your phone so you can google all those words while shopping?</p>
            <p>This is a simple and free resource and conversion site for anyone to use.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="about-heading-2">

            <p>Simply fill out the form asking for the name of your pet food product and any ingredients that you're curious about.
                You'll get back a shareable and bookmarkable result page letting you know exactly what's in your pet food.</p>
            <p>Or you can check out our protein calculators to quickly compare the actual protein contents (not including water) of any 2 foods.</p>
            <p><i>🐕This currently only works for cat and dog food products sold in the US or EU as our database only uses the FDA and FEDIAF's standards regarding pet food naming and content for now.🐈</i></p>
